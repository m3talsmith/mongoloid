Mongoloid
=========

Coming from Ruby and the brilliant Mongoid gem, it was a bit of a shock to see the state of MongoDB wrappers in NodeJs. So we decided to create Mongoloid; a Mongoid like ODM with a few nice touches we always wanted in Mongoid.

Unusable. Seriously. We are just putting together the tests that will form the api of this project. We'll update this as we go along. We are going to launch a couple of projects on this in the coming months, so expect fairly quick iterations after we are happy with the coverage.
